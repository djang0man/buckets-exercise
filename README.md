buckets exercise
===
> An interactive take on the classic [water pouring puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pouring_puzzle).

description
===
Essentially a game... click the buttons to move water from bucket to bucket until the target volume is reached.

goals
===
To gain more experience with functional component development and [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

setup
===
Issue `npm run watch` to spin up a dev localhost.<br />
Issue `npm build` followed by `npm run start` to serve a production build.<br />
Initial state, bucket capacities, and target volume can be modified in the `./src/constants` file.

next steps
===
This was not a test-driven exercise. The next step is to layer in some testing for fun and good practice.

Enjoy!
